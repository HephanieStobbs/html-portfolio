<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hi! I'm Steph, and I'm an aspiring web developer!</h2>
<p>I first got interested in coding the first time I started working for a web development company, but it never felt like something I would be able to do.</p>

<p>After getting made redundant from that company in 2020 (yes...bad timing!) I decided to learn some Python...but with only textbooks to guide me and the panic to find a new job took priority, the coding dream was tucked away again.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2023, working at another tech company that found itself making mass layoffs, the idea surfaced again...this time stronger... and less panicked by being unemployed during a pandemic! With my closest friends telling me I'd be a great dev, and a recent 'on a whim' purchase of Angela Yu's Beginners web development course on Udemy, I decided the time was now! Wish me luck!</p>
